#### posting from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18306362/run-r-script-from-command-line

We have a file, called `hello.r`, it has a `chmod` of 755,
```{r}
sayHello <- function(){
  print('Hello World')
}
```

We would like to run this via command line.

### Using `Rscript`
If you want the output to print to the terminal,

```
Rscript test.r
```


### Using `R CMD BATCH`
